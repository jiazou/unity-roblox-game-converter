# Unity → Roblox Game Converter

Convert Unity game projects into Roblox place files (`.rbxl`). Parses scenes
and prefabs, maps materials to `SurfaceAppearance`, transpiles C# scripts to
Luau via Claude AI, decimates meshes for Roblox polygon limits, and optionally
uploads to Roblox Cloud.

Available as an **interactive Claude Code skill** (`/convert-unity`) or as a
standalone batch CLI.

## Quick Start

### Interactive skill (recommended)

In Claude Code, run:

```
/convert-unity
```

The skill walks you through each conversion phase, pausing at decision points:
- **Scene selection** — pick which scenes to include
- **Material review** — decide how to handle unconvertible materials
- **Script triage** — review flagged C# → Luau transpilations (accept, retry with AI, edit, skip)
- **Mesh quality** — confirm decimation results
- **Upload** — optionally push to Roblox Cloud

Conversion state is persisted to `<output_dir>/.convert_state.json`, so you can
resume a partially completed conversion or re-run individual phases.

### Batch CLI (no interaction)

```bash
python converter.py ./MyUnityProject ./roblox_output
```

Runs the full pipeline end-to-end without pausing. Best for CI/CD or when you
don't need to review intermediate results.

## How to Run

### Option A: Interactive skill (`/convert-unity`)

The recommended way to run a conversion. The skill asks you for the Unity
project path and output directory, then guides you through each phase:

1. **Discover** — scans scenes and prefabs, lets you choose which to include
2. **Inventory** — catalogs assets and GUIDs, flags duplicates/orphans
3. **Materials** — converts materials, presents unconvertible ones for review
4. **Transpile** — converts C# to Luau, shows flagged scripts for triage
5. **Validate** — checks generated Luau for syntax errors
6. **Assemble** — builds the .rbxl file
7. **Upload** — (optional) pushes to Roblox Cloud
8. **Report** — generates the final conversion summary

Each phase can be re-run independently if you change your mind or want to
try different settings.

### Option B: Batch CLI (`converter.py`)

```bash
python converter.py <unity_project_path> <output_dir> [OPTIONS]
```

Runs the full pipeline without stopping. Use this for automation, CI/CD, or
when you're confident the defaults are fine.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `unity_project_path` | Path to the root of your Unity project (must contain an `Assets/` folder) |
| `output_dir` | Directory where `converted_place.rbxl` and `conversion_report.json` will be written |

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--api-key KEY` | `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key (**required** for C# → Luau transpilation) |
| `--verbose` / `--no-verbose` | `True` | Include per-script detail in the JSON report |
| `--roblox-api-key KEY` | `$ROBLOX_API_KEY` | Roblox Open Cloud API key (**required** for portal upload) |
| `--universe-id ID` | — | Roblox universe (experience) ID for upload |
| `--place-id ID` | — | Roblox place ID for upload |
| `--decimate` / `--no-decimate` | `True` | Conservative mesh decimation for Roblox polygon limits |

### Examples

```bash
# Using environment variable
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... python converter.py ./MyUnityProject ./roblox_output

# Specify API key inline
python converter.py ./MyUnityProject ./roblox_output --api-key sk-ant-...

# Upload to Roblox (requires Open Cloud API key)
python converter.py ./MyUnityProject ./roblox_output \
    --roblox-api-key YOUR_ROBLOX_KEY \
    --universe-id 123456 \
    --place-id 789012
```

### Output

├── .convert_state.json           ← Interactive conversion state (resume support)
└── conversion_report.json        ← Full conversion summary
```

### Portal Upload

To upload directly to Roblox, you need a **Roblox Open Cloud API key** with
publish permissions. Without a valid key, the converter writes the `.rbxl`
file locally and you can open it manually in Roblox Studio.

1. Create an API key at https://create.roblox.com/credentials
2. Grant it the **Place — Write** permission for your experience
3. Pass it via `--roblox-api-key` or the `ROBLOX_API_KEY` environment variable

### Mesh Decimation

Roblox limits MeshParts to 10 000 polygons. The converter applies
**conservative** decimation by default:

- Meshes already under the limit are copied unchanged.
- Over-budget meshes are reduced to 8 000 faces (leaving headroom).
- A quality floor of 60% prevents visually destructive simplification.
- Original files are never modified — decimated copies go to `meshes/`.

Disable with `--no-decimate` if you prefer to handle mesh optimization yourself.

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to change defaults (paths, model name, confidence threshold, etc.)
without modifying any pipeline module.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"An Anthropic API key is required"**
Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or pass `--api-key`.
You can get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

**Meshes appear as flat gray in Roblox Studio**
This usually means FBX vertex colors aren't being baked. Install the `assimp`
system library:

```bash
# macOS
brew install assimp

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev
```

**"trimesh not installed" warnings**
Install with `pip install trimesh`. Mesh decimation and splitting require it.

**Large project runs slowly**
The interactive CLI re-parses scenes in the `assemble` phase. For very large
projects (100+ scenes), use the batch CLI which runs a single pass.

**Binary .rbxl upload fails**
The Open Cloud API only accepts binary `.rbxl` files. Make sure `lz4` is
installed (`pip install lz4`) for the binary writer.

---

## Known Limitations

See [`docs/UNSUPPORTED.md`](docs/UNSUPPORTED.md) for the full list. Key ones:

- **Vertex colors** — Roblox ignores FBX vertex colors; the converter bakes them
  to textures for OBJ/PLY/GLB, and uses a dominant-color fallback for FBX
- **One material per MeshPart** — multi-material meshes are automatically split
  via `mesh_splitter.py`; falls back to first material when trimesh can't split
- **UV tiling > 4x** — pre-tiled automatically up to 4x; higher factors need
  mesh UV editing
- **Terrain** — Unity Terrain is recognized but not converted (planned)
- **Animations** — Animator controllers are parsed into config tables but
  runtime playback (AnimatorBridge) is not yet integrated into the pipeline
